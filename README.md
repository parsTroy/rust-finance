# Rusty Budget Calc

## Description

This is a small desktop app created in Rust, with Slint. 
I made this for budgeting my annual salary to follow a modified version of the 50/30/20 Rule.
When the salary is input, it will calculate what portion of the salary should go in the following categories.

-- Where I live it's roughly 30% Tax, that is taken into account. 
-- Then the breakdown is as follows:
    -- Necessities - 35%
    -- Wants       - 10.5%
    -- Investments - 24.5%
Including taxes that is how I like to spend 100% of income. ("Doesn't everyone LOVE taxes!!!")


- Taxes
- Necessities
- Wants
- Investments

## Installation

`cargo run` to run it.

## Usage

Input your salary, and receieve a calculation of how to budget your income.
