# Rusty Budget Calc

## Description

This is a small desktop app created in Rust, with Slint. 
I made this for budgeting my annual salary to follow a modified version of the 50/30/20 Rule.
When the salary is input, it will calculate what portion of the salary should go in the following categories.

- Taxes
- Necessities
- Wants
- Investments

## Installation

***cargo run*** to run it.

## Usage

Input your salary.
